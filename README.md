# Image-File-Compression-Decompression

In this we have tried to implement the Discrete Cosine Transform image Compression algorithm. We can compress grayscale BMP images .
# Features:
- Both compresses and decompresses imgage files .
- It also handles Folder and compress all the files inside folder  and output new folder with all compresses files .
- It decompress  only those files which are compressed by this project .
- It stores compressed file in binary file format .
# Usage
- Clone the repository on your machine.
- Open Terminal and change directory to the project directory.
- Type command ' make all' which will compile the required files and generate executable file.
- project  [-c] | [-d] [File or Folder Name ] [-o] [Output File/Foleder name ]

# Results :
- Using this project we can compress up 250 kB of image file
